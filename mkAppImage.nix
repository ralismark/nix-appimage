  # Workaround for writeClosure bug.
  #
  # Due to a bug in Nix, writeClosure with a path *under* a nix store path (e.g.
  # /nix/store/...-hello/bin/hello) raises the error "path '$program' is not in
  # the Nix store".

  # See: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/316652
  # See: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/10549
  #
  # This should be fixed in the latest version of Nix, however version where
  # this bug is present are still common, so we work around it by using the old
  # implementation of writeReferencesToFile from
